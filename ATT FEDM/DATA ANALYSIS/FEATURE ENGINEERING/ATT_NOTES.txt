filter methods = nagtatangal ng features 
wrapper methods =
embedded =  

to reduce the number of features 
mas madali naiintindihan ni machine 
mas mabilis 

purpose
1. visualization 
2. Modelling 

feature selection - reduce the number of features, manually nagbabawas. 
feature extraction - nagrreduce but not disregarding the original features. 
  - improved accuracy 
  - no overfitting 
  - speed uo in training 
  - imroved data visualization
  - increase in explainability of our model

PCA (Principal Components Analysis) - Dimensionality reduction 
- kinukuha correlation between each components
- Mostly used in classification regression

ICA (Independent Component Analysis) - 
- kinukuha yung independent na dapat ay walang similarity

LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) - check the distance between classes

LLE (Locally Linear EMbedding)- Similar kay PCA but non-linear.

t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor EMbedding)- typically used to visualize high dimensional datasets 

kelan ginagawa : before or after modelling. 
feature engineering : we are creating a new feature based on the old feature. 

model na magppredict kung BA or NT ang kkuhanin 
features - grades, demographics, track/strand nung k-12
may 6 - pasahan

kapag continous at hindi categorical ang target variable, regression analysis ang gagamitin. 

ano-ano yung mga variable na gagamitin niyo in order to predict the construction days?
